    chapterName: Getting to know gasses
    chapterNumber: 1
    chapterSummaryDescription: 'Find out that gasses have the following properties:
      mass, volume, temperature, and pressure'
    fullDescription: The relationship between mass, volume, temperature, and pressure
      is essential in understanding gas behavior, as changes in one property can
      significantly affect the others.

    chapterName: "Gay-Lussac\u2019s Law"
    chapterNumber: 2
    chapterSummaryDescription: Investigating the relationship between temperature
      and pressure at constant volume.
    fullDescription: Exploring the relationship of temperature and pressure at constant
      volume demonstrates that raising the temperature increases pressure as a result
      of greater molecular movement.
